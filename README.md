# Thunderbird-Addon-DeleteRow

UNDER DEVELOPMENT -DOES NOT WORK YET!

Extension that implements a button in the Compose Window to delete a row of a table.
The click on the button does the same as clicking the menu commands "Format" -> "Table" -> "Delete" -> "Row(s)".

(Based on a "WebExtension Experiment", compatible with Thunderbird 68, without using legacy code.)
